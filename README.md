# Book-tracking-project

Library Book Tracker with Collections: Develop a console application for a library book tracking system. Use collections to store information about books, including their title, author, and availability status. Implement functions to borrow and return books, updating their status in the collection. Use inheritance to represent different types of books (e.g., Fiction, Non-Fiction). Incorporate LINQ to filter and display available books.
